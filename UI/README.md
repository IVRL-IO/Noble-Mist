# Why not chat via-Discord?
You are free to reach out to the Discord team and ask them to open the API up to alternative clients. However, we can not provide integration as it's a Terms of Service violation.

# Why not X blockchain messenger
None exist. We found two possible messengers. One has not launched, and the other I can't even understand the documentation if it's possible to make your own client.
